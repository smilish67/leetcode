# my fisrt attempt was filing nums1's empty areas with nums2. and sorting using selection sort
# time-complexity : O(n^2)
# Another method could be different sorting algorithms like merge. (O(n*logN))

# This problem asks conquer process since it gives already sorted two divided arrays.

# So my second attempt was two pointer solving conquer process sequentially.
# But sequential two pointer was hard, because it seemed constrained for using other array.
# pushing is needed
